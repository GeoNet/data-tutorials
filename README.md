# Data Tutorials

The purpose of this repository is to provide a home for several Data tutorials written to improve the accesibility of the different GeoNet's data sets. This repository provides an easy way to access the tutorials, versioning and allows the users to suggest changes or improvements.

The files in these folders are [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that will demonstrate some simple ways to retrieve data from different services such as: FDSN, FITS, etc. in Python and R programming languages. 

## Summary of Tutorials

| Data type  | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [Seismic Data](Seismic_Data) | Demostrative tutorials showing how to get data throught the different FDSN web services (Dataselect, Station and Event). The Tutorials are presented in Jupyter notebooks written in Python and R Programming languages.|
| [GNSS Data](GNSS_Data) | Demostrative tutorials to retrieve and perform basics task with GNSS Data, mostly with the use of FITS API. The Tutorials are presented in Jupyter notebooks written in Python and R Programming languages.|
| [Volcano Data](Volcano_Data) | Demostrative tutorials to access Volcano Data with the use of FITS API and FDSN Web services. The Tutorials are presented in Jupyter notebooks written in Python and R Programming languages.|
| [Tide Gauge Data](Tide_Gauge_Data) | Demonstrates how to get water level sensor data. The Tutorials are presented in Jupyter notebooks written in Python|

## How to Run Tutorials
There are 3 files in this GitHub repository to help run these tutorials.
- The [**environment.yml**](environment.yml) file installs everything under dependencies using `conda install -c conda-forge (packagename)`  This is used to install the Python packages.
- [**install.R**](install.R) is R code for installing all R packages used in these tutorials
- [**runtime.txt**](runtime.txt) This file is for binder. Every day there is a snapshot of R taken. This install the snapshot of R taken on the date in this file. 

### 1. In Anaconda
Install anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ 
This can be done on Windows, Mac, and Linux. The code for the Anaconda prompt will be the same on all operating systems
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

**Open the Anaconda prompt and run each line of code below.**


**Clone the git**

`git clone https://github.com/GeoNet/data-tutorials.git`



`cd data-tutorials`




**Install all packages used**

Install the environment file

`conda env create -f environment.yml`


Activate this environment 


`activate GeoNet`


**Clone the git**

`git clone https://github.com/GeoNet/data-tutorials.git`


`cd data-tutorials`




**Install all packages used**

Install the environment file

`conda env create -f environment.yml`


Activate this environment 


`conda activate GeoNet`

Install Jupyter

`conda install -c anaconda jupyter`

Install R


` conda install -c conda-forge r-base`

Install Python 

`conda install -c conda-forge python=3.6`



Install the R kernel


`conda install -c conda-forge  r-irkernel`

Install the Python kernel

` conda install -c conda-forge ipykernel`



Run the R script to install all R packages. 

`Rscript install.R`



**Open Jupyter notebook**

`jupyter notebook`

To reopen notebooks, open the Anaconda prompt and run 

`cd data-tutorials`

`conda activate GeoNet`

`jupyter notebook`

### 2. In your preferred GUI (Graphical User Interface)
If you wish to run just the code and not the notebooks you can use your own GUI for Python or R

**In your preferred R GUI**

Run the code in the file https://github.com/GeoNet/data-tutorials/blob/master/install.R to install all packages used in all notebooks. Code can then be copied across. Make sure to call packages and run any other code that may be in the beginning of the notebook but is needed for running other code in the notebook. 

**In your preferred Python GUI**

You will need to install all packages under dependencies in the file https://github.com/GeoNet/data-tutorials/blob/master/environment.yml. Some of these packages can't be installed using `pip` and as such may have to be installed from there GitHub.  Code can then be copied across. Make sure to call packages and run any other code that may be in the beginning of the notebook but is needed for running other code in the notebook.  

### 3. In Binder [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/GeoNet/data-tutorials/master)

<<<<<<< HEAD
My Binder is an experimental project still in beta phase that can be used to run notebooks. Any issues with binder can be reported at there project's GitHub  https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub

My Binder is an experimental project still in beta phase that can be used to run notebooks. Any issues with binder can be reported at their project's GitHub  https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub 


[My Binder](https://mybinder.org/) is a free online tool to be able to run jupyter notebooks without installing anything on your computer. Binder will launch in your internet browser. 
There are some important things to note when using binder. 

- Binder can take up to 2 minutes to start
- The things you do in binder will **NOT save** for the next time you open binder
- Binder has a **time limit**. If the tab is **inactive** for more than 10 minutes (not running code or have someone scroll on the page) it will time out and you will need to restart it. 

If you want to save a csv or image you have made in binder click on the box next to it (in the file select) and click download. 
You can also do this with the notebook itself.
If you want to run a notebook you have save to your computer in binder you can click upload and upload a saved notebook from your computer.
Each cell of code can be run with `shift + enter` or you can run the entire notebook by selecting `cell`, `Run All` in the toolbar.
The Following link should open the Jupyter Notebook in your browser using Binder:
