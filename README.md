# Data Tutorials

The purpose of this repository is to provide a home for several data tutorials written to improve the accesibility of the different GeoNet data sets. This repository is an easy way to access the tutorials, provides versioning and allows the users to suggest changes or improvements.

The files in these folders are mostly [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/). They demonstrate some simple ways to retrieve and work with data from different GeoNet services such as: FDSN, FITS, Tilde, etc. Most are written in the Python programming language. Older versions of some notebooks were written in the R programming language. We are no longer supporting these, but the notebooks are still available, although we make no guarantee about their current usability. To access these notebooks, please use this [github commit](https://github.com/GeoNet/data-tutorials/tree/5609561894b924211da975d1794eb00b5fcff99d).

**All notebooks use Python 3. We do not support Python 2.7.**

Tutorials are reviewed every 3 - 6 months. We confirm that they still run, and make any necessary adjustments so that they remain a valuable, working resource for GeoNet's data users.

Tutorials are organised by data access method, rather than data type. Within the folder for each data access method is a file README.md. This file contains most of the general material about data accessed by that method. This frees up individual notebooks to concentrate on data access and use, and reduces the maintenance required for each notebook. When you are using a particular notebook, it is therefore important that you refer to the README.md file in the same folder as the notebook.

## Summary of Tutorials

| Data access method | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [AWS Open Data](./AWS_Open_Data) | A file README.md describing GeoNet's data available through AWS Open Data |
| [FDSN](./FDSN) | Demonstrates how to access data through GeoNet's different FDSN web services (Dataselect, Station and Event). These tutorials are applicable to **seismic**, **acoustic-infrasound**, and **tsunami gauge (full sample rate)** data sets. |
| [FITS](./FITS) | Shows how to retrieve and use data from [FITS](https://fits.geonet.org.nz/api-docs/). FITS is used to access **daily GNSS position data**, **manually collected volcano data**, and **volcano data logger data (limited cases)**. FITS is in the process of being replaced by [Tilde](https://tilde.geonet.org.nz/), and will later be deprecated. |
| [Tilde](./Tilde) | Shows how to retrieve data from GeoNet's [Tilde API](https://tilde.geonet.org.nz/v3/api-docs/). These turorails apply to **DART**, **envirosensor**, and **tsunami gauge (down-sampled)** data. Tutorials cover Tilde's data, stats, and data summary APIs.

## How to Run Tutorials
The file [**environment.yml**](environment.yml) ensures that you have the correct Python environment to run the data tutorials. It allows you to install the correct Python packages, and where appropriate package versions. We use this environment when writing and reviewing notebooks. If you use a different environment, tutorials may work, but we cannot guarantee it.

### 1. Python environment manager
We use [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to manage our Python environments. Other environment managers such as [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) are also suitable. Both support Windows, Mac, and Linux. If you do not yet have a python environment manager, we recommend you install one as you need a specific environment for the notebooks to work correctly.

### 2. Get the data-tutorials material
You have three options.
#### a) Clone the git data-tutorials repository
`git clone https://github.com/GeoNet/data-tutorials.git`
### b) Copy the zip file containing the code
Click on green `<>Code` icon near the top of the page and then `Download ZIP`.
This will create a file `data-tutorials-main.zip` on your computer, which you will need to uncompress to access the notebooks. All common file compression tools will uncompress the ZIP file.
### c) Copy and paste
Navigate to a section of a notebook you are interested in and copy-paste the code you want to use into a notebook on your computer.

### 3. Install the environment file
Create an environment called `GeoNet` from the specifications in the file `environment.yml`.

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

And then activate this environment.

`conda activate GeoNet`

Install the Python kernel in this environment.

`conda install -c conda-forge ipykernel`

`python -m ipykernel install --user --name=GeoNet`

We recommend using [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) rather than the older Jupyter Notebook.

If you don't have JupyterLab installed, here are [detailed instructions](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/installation.html).

Open JupyterLab

From the Linux command line

`jupyter lab`

To reopen jupyter notebooks when opening a new command prompt, navigate to your working directory and run,

`conda activate base`

`conda activate GeoNet`

`jupyter notebook`

### 4. Running tutorials as standalone scripts
Tutorials are only available as Jupyter notebooks. If you want to run a notebook as a standalone Python script you can do that. Open the notebook in JupyterLab and export it as an [Executable Script](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/export.html).
