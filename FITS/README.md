# FITS #

The files in this folder are Jupyter notebooks written in Python. They demonstrate some simple ways to use [GeoNet's FITS data service](https://fits.geonet.org.nz/api-docs/), typically using the Python [Pandas module](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

They apply to all data types available through FITS:
- GNSS daily positions
- manually collected volcano data
- volcano data logger data (limited cases)

Other data types are available through other applications.

FITS is the process of being replaced by [Tilde](https://tilde.geonet.org.nz/), and will later be deprecated.

## Python ##

**All notebooks use Python 3. We do not support Python 2.7.**
